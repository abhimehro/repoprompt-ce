After outputting JSON objects for all changed files, output a final JSON object with an overall summary, surrounded by ###JSON_START### and ###JSON_END### delimiters:

###JSON_START###
{
"overall_summary": "Brief summary of the main improvements suggested across all files."
}
###JSON_END###

let diffStructurePrompt = """
For each file requiring modifications, structure your output as follows:

1. Input Format:
You will receive code snippets with line numbers and encoded indentation. Indentation is represented as follows:
- <s4> indicates 4 spaces
- <t2> indicates 2 tabs
- <s0> or <t0> indicates no indentation

2. Thought Process:
Begin with a brief plan for the changes using <th> tags. Describe your approach, including what you plan to add, remove, or modify. Reference specific line number ranges. For example:

<th>To improve error handling, I'll add a try-catch block around the database query on lines 15-18. I'll also modify the logging statement on line 20 to include more detailed error information.</th>

3. JSON Diff Format:
 Present each change as a JSON diff using the following format:

###JSON_START###
{
 "file_path": "path/to/file.ext",
 "changes": [
  {
   "description": "Brief description of the change",
   "start_line": 10,
   "chunk": [
	"10:<s4>// Existing line for context",
	"-11:<s4>// Line to be removed or modified",
	"+<s4>// New line to be added",
	"12:<s4>// Another existing line for context"
   ]
  }
 ]
}
###JSON_END###

4. Guidelines for Changes:

a. Line Numbers and Formatting:
- Include line numbers for all existing lines, including those to be removed.
- Line numbers should be sequential and reflect the original file structure.
- Do not include line numbers for newly added lines (use '+' prefix).
- Use '-' before the line number to indicate removal or modification of an existing line.
- Use '+' at the start of a line (without a line number) to indicate a new addition.
- The 'start_line' should correspond to the first line in the chunk.

b. Context
- Always Include 1-3 lines of context before and after the change. This helps anchor the program parsing your change in the context of the existing file.
- Do not use + on lines that already exist in the original file, or that line will show up twice in the final file.

c. Indentation:
- Preserve the indentation of each line as given in the input using encoded indentation format {eg: <s2> or <t1>}.
- Maintain consistency in indentation style (spaces or tabs) as used in the original file.

d. Code Integrity:
- Preserve existing names (classes, functions, variables) unless instructed otherwise.
- Maintain code functionality and adhere to best practices.
- Ensure syntactical correctness:
  * Properly match and place brackets {}, parentheses (), and semicolons ;
  * Preserve correct indentation and scope definition
- Respect language-specific structures (e.g., Python's significant whitespace, C#'s using directives)
- Maintain type consistency in strongly-typed languages
- Preserve or properly modify existing error handling
- Ensure correct function calls (argument count and types)
- When modifying control structures or loops, maintain logical integrity

e. JSON Formatting:
- Use properly escaped strings and characters in your JSON output:
 * Escape double quotes within string values using a backslash (\\\").
 * Escape backslashes with another backslash (\\\\\\\\).
 * Use \\\\n for newlines, \\\\t for tabs, and other appropriate escape sequences.
 * Ensure all special characters in strings are properly escaped to maintain valid JSON.

5. Multiple Changes:
 If multiple changes are required in a single file, include separate change objects within the "changes" array of the JSON diff.

6. Complete Response:
 Your complete response for each file should include the thought process (<th> tags) followed by the JSON diff (###JSON_START### and ###JSON_END### tags).

Example of input code with line numbers and indentation markers:

File: calculator.py
Path: Utilities/calculator.py
Line count: 12

Content:
1:<s0>def calculate_sum(a, b):
2:<s4>result = a + b
3:<s4>return result
4:<s0>
5:<s0>def main():
6:<s4>x = 5
7:<s4>y = 10
8:<s4>total = calculate_sum(x, y)
9:<s4>print(f"The sum is: {total}")
10:<s0>
11:<s0>if __name__ == "__main__":
12:<s4>main()

Example of a complete response:

<th>
To improve the functionality and readability of the code, I'll modify the calculate_sum function to handle potential errors and add type hints. I'll also update the main function to include error handling and improve the output format.
</th>

let extraRules = """
Your responses will be applied directly by a native app that will parse this output JSON and modify files directly. For each change, ensure that:
1. The file_path exactly matches the input file path. Do not attempt to correct or modify file names or paths, even if they appear to contain typos or errors.
2. start_line accurately reflects the first line in the chunk, including context lines.
3. The chunk contains the complete change, including context lines.
4. No placeholders or filler text is used in the code sections.
5. Each change is complete and can be applied without further modification.
6. The JSON objects are valid and properly formatted.
7. There are no comments or explanations outside of the JSON objects.
8. Always use the exact file path as provided in the input, without any modifications.
9. Do not change class names, function names, or variable names unless explicitly instructed to do so.
10. All strings in the JSON output are properly escaped, following the guidelines in rule 11 above.
Do not add any commentary outside of the delimiters. Within the delimiters, there should only be valid JSON objects. Do not include any markdown formatting or code blocks outside of the JSON objects.
